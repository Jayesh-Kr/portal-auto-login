## Installation

### Method 1: Load as Unpacked Extension (Development)

2. **Open Chrome** and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. **Enable Developer Mode** (toggle switch in top-right corner)
4. **Click "Load unpacked"** and select the `my-extension` folder
5. **Configure credentials** by clicking on the extension icon and selecting "Configure Credentials"

### Method 2: Installation from Chrome Web Store (Coming Soon)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Credentials

1. Click on the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
2. Click "Configure Credentials" or right-click the extension ‚Üí "Options"
3. Enter your SRM Student Portal username and password
4. Click "Save Credentials"

Your credentials are encrypted using AES-256 encryption before being stored locally.

### 2. Test Auto-Login

1. Visit the SRM Student Portal: https://student.srmap.edu.in/srmapstudentcorner/HRDSystem
2. The extension will automatically:
   - Fill in your username and password
   - Capture and solve the captcha using OCR
   - Submit the login form

## How It Works

### 1. Credential Storage
- Uses Web Crypto API for AES-GCM encryption
- PBKDF2 key derivation with 100,000 iterations
- All data stored locally in Chrome's secure storage

### 2. OCR Processing
- Captures captcha image from the page
- Converts to base64 format
- Processes with Tesseract.js OCR engine
- Filters results for confidence threshold (>80%)

### 3. Form Automation
- Intelligently finds form fields using multiple selectors
- Simulates user input with proper event triggering
- Handles various form submission methods

## Security Features

- **Local Storage Only**: No data ever leaves your device
- **AES-256 Encryption**: Military-grade encryption for stored credentials
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: No sensitive information in source code
- **Permission Minimal**: Only requests necessary permissions
- **Open Source**: Full source code available for security review

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working
1. Make sure you're on the correct login page
2. Check if credentials are saved in options
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Check browser console for error messages

### Captcha Recognition Issues
- The extension requires clear captcha images
- If OCR confidence is below 80%, manual input is required
- Some captchas may be too distorted for automatic recognition

### Clear Data and Reset
1. Click extension icon ‚Üí "Clear Stored Data"
2. Or go to `chrome://extensions/` ‚Üí Extension details ‚Üí "Extension options"
3. Use "Clear Stored Data" button to reset everything
